# ðŸš§ Automatic Gate Control System with Ultrasonic Sensor

This Arduino project controls a gate using an ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, LEDs, and a piezo buzzer. The gate opens automatically when an object (like a person or car) is detected nearby and closes after a short delay.

## ðŸ›  Features

- Ultrasonic distance detection
- Automatic gate control using a servo motor
- Visual feedback using red (closed) and blue (open) LEDs
- Audible buzzer alert while the gate is open
- Auto-close after 5 seconds
- Software-controlled ground for additional flexibility

## ðŸ”Œ Hardware Required

- Arduino Uno or compatible board
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Servo Motor (e.g., SG90)
- Red LED
- Blue LED
- 2x 220Î© resistors (for LEDs)
- Piezo Buzzer
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
